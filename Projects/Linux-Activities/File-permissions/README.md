<h1>Scenario</h1>

You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

 # Professional Objective: File Permission Management for Researcher2

In this scenario, you must examine and manage the permissions on the files in the `/home/researcher2/projects` directory for the `researcher2` user.

The `researcher2` user is part of the `research_team` group.

## Task Overview:
You must check the permissions for all files in the directory, including any hidden files, to ensure that permissions align with the authorization that should be given. If permissions do not align, you must change the permissions.

### Steps to Complete the Task:

1. **Check Permissions:**
   - Examine the user and group permissions for all files in the `/home/researcher2/projects` directory.
   - Ensure that hidden files are included in the check.

2. **Identify Incorrect Permissions:**
   - Check for any files with incorrect permissions.
   - Identify files that do not align with the expected authorization.

3. **Change Permissions:**
   - Modify the file permissions where necessary to ensure correct access is granted.

4. **Drafts Directory Permissions:**
   - Check the permissions of the `/home/researcher2/projects/drafts` directory.
   - Remove any unauthorized access to ensure only the appropriate users and groups have the necessary permissions.

By following these steps, you will ensure that the permissions in the `projects` directory and its subdirectories are appropriately set and that unauthorized access is prevented.
