# Home Asset Inventory

## Project Description
One of the most valuable assets in the world today is **information**. Most information is accessed over a network. A variety of devices tend to be connected to a network, and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight **sensitive assets** that require extra protection. 

This project involves creating an inventory of devices connected to a home office network to identify which devices contain sensitive information and require additional security measures.

## Categories for Sensitivity Levels
- **Restricted**: Need-to-know access
- **Confidential**: Limited to specific users
- **Internal-only**: Users on-premises
- **Public**: Accessible by anyone

## Asset Inventory Table

| Asset                  | Network Access | Owner                     | Location           | Notes                                                                                   | Sensitivity    |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Network Router**      | Continuous     | Internet service provider (ISP) | On-premises        | Has a 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz connection. All devices on the home network connect to 5 GHz.    | Confidential   |
| **Desktop**             | Occasional     | Homeowner                  | On-premises        | Contains private information, like photos.                                               | Restricted     |
| **Guest Smartphone**    | Occasional     | Friend                     | On and off-premises | Connects to my home network.                                                             | Internal-only  |
| **Smart Home Devices**  | Occasional     | Homeowner                  | On and off-premises | Connects to my home network.                                                             | Internal-only  |
| **Storage Devices/Servers** | Continuous     | Cloud provider             | On-premises        | Contains database for my projects.                                                      | Confidential   |
| **Laptop**              | Occasional     | Homeowner                  | On-premises        | Contains work files.                                                                     | Restricted     |

## Conclusion
By compiling an asset inventory, homeowners can effectively classify devices based on sensitivity and importance. This allows for better **risk management** and **protection** of valuable information and assets connected to the network.
