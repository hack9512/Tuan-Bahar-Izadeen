## Projects

### 1. Home Asset Inventory
**Objective**: This project involved creating an inventory of devices connected to a home office network. Each device was classified based on its sensitivity level and network access.
- **Key Concepts**: Asset management, risk categorization, sensitivity levels.
- **Deliverable**: [Home Asset Inventory](https://github.com/hack9512/Tuan-Bahar-Izadeen/blob/Tuan/Projects/Assets%20%26%20Threats%20%26%20Vulnerabilities/Home%20asset%20inventory.md)

### 2. Risk Register
**Objective**: The Risk Register outlines potential threats to assets and assigns likelihood and severity scores to prioritize the risks. This project highlights effective risk management techniques.
- **Key Concepts**: Risk assessment, likelihood and severity scoring, risk prioritization.
- **Deliverable**: [Risk Register](https://github.com/hack9512/Tuan-Bahar-Izadeen/blob/Tuan/Projects/Assets%20%26%20Threats%20%26%20Vulnerabilities/Risk%20register.md)

### 3. Data Leak Worksheet
**Objective**: This worksheet addresses an incident involving a data leak of internal business plans. It applies the principle of least privilege to identify weaknesses and recommend solutions.
- **Key Concepts**: Data protection, least privilege, NIST SP 800-53 guidelines.

- **Key Concepts**: Cryptographic hashing, integrity verification, SHA-256.
- **Deliverable**: [Compare Hash Values](https://github.com/hack9512/Tuan-Bahar-Izadeen/blob/Tuan/Projects/Assets%20%26%20Threats%20%26%20Vulnerabilities/Compare%20hash%20values.md)

### 5. Decrypt an Encrypted Message
**Objective**: This project demonstrates how to decrypt a message encrypted using the AES-256-CBC algorithm. The project walks through key-based decryption and the importance of secure encryption.
- **Key Concepts**: Symmetric encryption, AES-256-CBC, decryption process.
- **Deliverable**: [Decrypt an Encrypted Message](https://github.com/hack9512/Tuan-Bahar-Izadeen/blob/Tuan/Projects/Assets%20%26%20Threats%20%26%20Vulnerabilities/Decrypt%20an%20encrypted%20message.md)

### 6. Access Control Worksheet
**Objective**: Analyzing an access control incident where an unauthorized transaction was almost executed, this project highlights the importance of proper user account management and privilege restrictions.
- **Key Concepts**: Access control, multi-factor authentication, role-based access.
- **Deliverable**: [Access Control Worksheet](https://github.com/hack9512/Tuan-Bahar-Izadeen/blob/Tuan/Projects/Assets%20%26%20Threats%20%26%20Vulnerabilities/Access%20control%20worksheet.md)

### 7. Vulnerability Assessment Report
**Objective**: This report evaluates the security of a system by identifying vulnerabilities, assessing their impact, and proposing mitigation strategies.
- **Key Concepts**: Vulnerability assessment, risk mitigation, patch management.
- **Deliverable**: [Vulnerability Assessment Report](https://github.com/hack9512/Tuan-Bahar-Izadeen/blob/Tuan/Projects/Assets%20%26%20Threats%20%26%20Vulnerabilities/Vulnerability%20assessment%20report.md)

### 8. Cyber Attack Mindset (Parking Lot USB Drive)
**Objective**: A scenario-based analysis where a USB drive found in a parking lot is used as an attack vector. This project explores how attackers can exploit curiosity and how to protect against social engineering attacks.
- **Key Concepts**: Cyber attack mindset, social engineering, attack vectors.
- **Deliverable**: [Cyber Attack Mindset](https://github.com/hack9512/Tuan-Bahar-Izadeen/blob/Tuan/Projects/Assets%20%26%20Threats%20%26%20Vulnerabilities/Cyber%20attack%20mindset.md)

### 9. PASTA Framework (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)
**Objective**: This project applies the PASTA framework to assess threats and vulnerabilities in a structured manner. It outlines the seven stages of the framework and how they help in threat modeling.
- **Key Concepts**: Threat modeling, PASTA framework, risk assessment.
- **Deliverable**: [PASTA Framework](https://github.com/hack9512/Tuan-Bahar-Izadeen/blob/Tuan/Projects/Assets%20%26%20Threats%20%26%20Vulnerabilities/PASTA%20framework.md)
