## Summary of Recommendations

Based on the above assessment, here are the key recommendations to address the identified gaps:

1. **Implement Least Privilege and Access Control Policies:**
   - Restrict access to sensitive data to only those employees who need it for their job functions. This will reduce the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

2. **Develop and Implement Disaster Recovery Plans:**
   - Establish a disaster recovery plan and ensure that regular backups of critical data are performed and tested to maintain business continuity.

3. **Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
   - Implement an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activities, allowing early detection and response to potential threats.

4. **Implement Data Encryption:**
   - Encrypt sensitive data, especially credit card information, to comply with PCI DSS and protect against data breaches.

5. **Establish a Password Management System:**
   - Implement a centralized password management system to enforce secure password practices and improve overall security.

6. **Enhance Data Classification and Inventory for GDPR Compliance:**
   - Properly classify and inventory all data, particularly E.U. customers’ data, to ensure full compliance with GDPR standards.

By addressing these recommendations, Botium Toys can significantly enhance its security posture and ensure compliance with relevant standards and regulations.
