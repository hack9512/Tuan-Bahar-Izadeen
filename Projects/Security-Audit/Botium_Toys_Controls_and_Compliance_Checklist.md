## Summary of Recommendations

Based on the above assessment, here are the key recommendations to address the identified gaps:

1. **Implement Least Privilege and Access Control Policies:**
   - This will reduce the risk of insider threats and ensure that employees have access only to the data necessary for their roles.

2. **Develop and Implement Disaster Recovery Plans:**
   - Creating and regularly testing disaster recovery plans will help ensure business continuity in the event of a major incident.
     
3. **Strengthen Password Policies:**
   - Update the password policy to meet current complexity standards and enforce it through a centralized password management system.

5. **Implement Data Encryption:**
   - Encrypt sensitive data, especially credit card information, to comply with PCI DSS and protect against data breaches.

6. **Establish a Password Management System:**
   - Implement a centralized password management system to enforce secure password practices and improve overall security.

7. **Enhance Data Classification and Inventory for GDPR Compliance:**
   - Properly classify and inventory all data, particularly E.U. customers’ data, to ensure full compliance with GDPR standards.
     
8. **Install an Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
   - This will provide the ability to detect and respond to potential security incidents more effectively

By addressing these recommendations, Botium Toys can significantly enhance its security posture and ensure compliance with relevant standards and regulations.
